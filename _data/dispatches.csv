23d June, 1813

SIR,

I have the honour of enclosing an Order of Council, dated the 10th instant which it has been judged expedient to issue in consequence of the continuance of Hostilities between His Majesty and the United States of America.

By this Order you are authorized to grant licenses for the importation of certain articles enumerated in the Order, and for the exportation of certain articles also enumerated in the said Order, in the ship in which the importations aforesaid shall have been previously made.

This intercourse is to be subject to the condition stated in the Order, and to such instructions as you may, from time to time, receive from one of His Majesty’s Principal Secretaries of State.

I am commanded by His Royal Highness the Prince Regent to signify to you, that, in granting the license for importation of the above enumerated articles, you take care that the articles, so to be imported be severally enumerated in the body of the license; that the port or place from whence the importation is to be made, and the port to which she is bound, be inserted in the body of the license; that is the person applying for the licence shall not be able to state the name f the vessel on board of which the proposed importation is to be made, the condition of the license should be, that the name of the vessel, the name of her master, her tonnage, and her national character, be endorsed n the license, on quitting her port of clearance, and that the condition of the license should also be, that se proceeds directly to her port of destination.

You will also take care that all licences under this order whether of import from or export to Ports of the United States be confined by express words in the body of the licence to ports not blockaded.

Although the Order of the council authorizes you to permit the importation of the enumerated articles in any vessel not French, you will not grant these licence to ay except to vessels in amity with His Majesty, unless you are convinced that the Isle of Dominica will be exposed to serious embarrassment by so confining the importation in question.

Whatever importations are proposed to be made under this Order from the United States of America should be by your licences confined to the ports of the Eastern States exclusively, unless you have reason to believe that the object of the Order would not be fulfilled if licences are not also granted for importation from the other ports belonging to the United States.

With respect to the licence for exportation on board the vessels in which an importation shall have been previously made, you will observe that the Order does not require that the port of destination in such case shall be the same as that from whence the importation had been made. But you will take care that in the body of the licence be inserted the name of the vessel, her tonnage, the name of her Master, and his national character, the port of clearance, and the port of destination, and the cargo be described in the body of the licence according to the words of the Order, viz. Rum, molasses, or any other goods and commodities whatsoever, except sugar, indigo, cotton-wool, coffee and cocoa.

You will take care that the term of the importation licence does not exceed the order under which it is granted, and that you do not issue and licence for exportation under this Order after that period. The fee payable for each licence is not in any case to exceed the sum of one pound one shilling.

I have the honour to be,
SIR,
Your most obedient
humble Servant,
